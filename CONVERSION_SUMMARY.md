## Rendering and Behavior

The rendering and behavior have been kept as close as possible to the existing site. However, due to the differences between Gatsby and MkDocs Material, there might be some minor visual or functional differences that may need further adjustment.

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

During the conversion process, we encountered some warnings that should be addressed in future updates:

1. Missing images: Some image files referenced in the markdown files are missing. These should be added to the appropriate locations in the project structure.
2. Broken links: There are some broken links in the markdown files that need to be updated or removed.
3. Documentation quality: Review and update the content of markdown files to ensure all information is up-to-date and relevant to the new MkDocs structure.

## Next Steps

1. Review the pull request and make any necessary adjustments based on feedback.
2. Address the warnings about missing images and broken links.
3. Perform a thorough testing of the new MkDocs site to ensure all functionality is working as expected.
4. Update any documentation or guides related to site maintenance to reflect the new MkDocs Material structure.

## Conclusion

The conversion from Gatsby to MkDocs Material has been largely successful, with all main requirements addressed. The site is now building and serving without critical errors. However, there are some minor issues and potential improvements that should be tackled in future updates to ensure the best possible documentation quality and user experience.
