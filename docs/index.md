# Welcome to DIDComm.org

![logo](../didcomm-logo.png)

DIDComm.org is the world's nexus for all things DIDComm -- [the spec](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.1/), documentation, examples, and a global registry of protocol definitions.

## Features

### Learn about DIDComm

Read [the guidebook](https://didcomm.org/book/v2/) or [the spec](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/v2.1/). Or, if you like video, watch an [introductory webinar](https://youtu.be/TBxWgNmsnvU). Learn how to control your security and privacy â€” over the web, email, push notifications, QR codes, BLE, NFC, message queues, sneaker net... [Find libraries](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging#implementations) or [connect with DIDComm's authors](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm-messaging/issues).

### Build a protocol

Application-level decentralized protocols are [built atop DIDComm](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0003-protocols/README.md). These support activities like secure chat, verifiable credential exchange, buying and selling, scheduling, escrow, bidding, ticketing, and so forth.

### Share a protocol

To register or modify a protocol definition, follow the [instructions](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm.org/blob/main/docs/pr-guide.md) and submit a PR against the /protocols folder of the [repo](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/didcomm.org).

## Contributing

The Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) sponsors a [DIDComm Working Group](https://identity.foundation/working-groups/did-comm.html) that meets weekly (Mondays at 3 pm Eastern, 9 pm Central Europe, noon Pacific, 5 am Tokyo) to discuss all things DIDComm. The general public can listen in.

To modify static HTML on this website, raise a PR against something in the `/docs` folder.
