# Motivation

Messages can be picked up simply by sending a message to the _Mediator_.

## Roles
There are two roles in this protocol: 

- `mediator`: The agent that has messages waiting for pickup by the `recipient`.
- `recipient`: The agent who is picking up messages from the `mediator`.

## Requirements

The `return_route` extension must be supported by both agents (`recipient` and `mediator`).
The common use of this protocol is for the reply messages from the `mediator` to be synchronous, utilizing the same connection channel for the reply. In order to have this synchronous behavior the `recipient` should specify `return_route` header to `all`.
This header must be set each time the communication channel is established: once per established websocket, and every message for an HTTP POST.


## Connectivity

This protocol consists of three different message requests from the `recipient` that should be replied to by the `mediator`:

1. Status Request -> Status
2. Delivery Request -> Message Delivery
3. Message Received -> Status
4. Live Mode  -> Status or Problem Report

## States

This protocol follows the request-response message exchange pattern, and only requires the simple state of waiting for a response or to produce a response. 

Additionally, the `return_route` header extension must be set to `all` in all request submitted by the `recipient`.

## Basic Walkthrough

The `status-request` message is sent by the `recipient` to the `mediator` to query how many messages are pending.

The `status` message is the response to `status-request` to communicate the state of the message queue.

The `delivery-request` message is sent by the `recipient` to request delivery of pending messages.

The `message-delivery` message is the response to the `delivery-request` to send queued messages back to the `recipient`.

The `message-received` message is sent by the `recipient` to confirm receipt of delivered messages, prompting the `mediator` to clear messages from the queue.

The `live-delivery-change` message is used to set the state of `live_delivery`.

When _Live Mode_ is enabled, messages that arrive when an existing connection exists are delivered over the connection immediately, rather than being pushed to the queue. See _Live Mode_ below for more details.

## Security

This protocol expects messages to be encrypted during transmission, and repudiable. 

## Message Reference

### Status Request
Sent by the `recipient` to the `mediator` to request a `status` message.

Message Type URI: `https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/status-request`

```json
{
    "id": "123456780",
    "type": "https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/status-request",
    "body" : {
        "recipient_did": "<did for messages>"
    },
    "return_route": "all"
}
```
`recipient_did` is optional. When specified, the `mediator` **MUST** only return status related to that recipient did. This allows the `recipient` to discover if any messages are in the queue that were sent to a specific did. 

### Status
Status details about waiting messages.

Message Type URI: `https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/status`

```json
{
    "id": "123456780",
    "type": "https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/status",
    "body": {
            "recipient_did": "<did for messages>",
            "message_count": 7,
            "longest_waited_seconds": 3600,
            "newest_received_time": 1658085169,
            "oldest_received_time": 1658084293,
            "total_bytes": 8096,
            "live_delivery": false
    }
}
```
`message_count` is the only **REQUIRED** attribute. The others **MAY** be present if offered by the `mediator`.

`longest_waited_seconds` is in seconds, and is the longest delay of any message in the queue.

`newest_received_time` and `oldest_received_time` are expressed in UTC Epoch Seconds (seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z) as an integer.

`total_bytes` represents the total size of all messages.

If a `recipient_did` was specified in the `status-request message`, the matching value **MUST** be specified in the `recipient_did` attribute of the status message.

`live_delivery` state is also indicated in the status message.

**Note**: due to the potential for confusing what the actual state of the message queue is, a status message **MUST NOT** be put on the pending message queue and **MUST** only be sent when the `recipient` is actively connected (HTTP request awaiting response, WebSocket, etc.).


### Delivery Request
A request from the `recipient` to the `mediator` to have pending messages delivered.

Message Type URI: `https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/delivery-request`

```json
{
    "id": "123456780",
    "type": "ttps://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/delivery-request",
    "body": {
        "limit": 10,
        "recipient_did": "<did for messages>"
    },
    "return_route": "all"
}
```
`limit` is a **REQUIRED** attribute, and after receipt of this message, the `mediator` **SHOULD** deliver up to the limit indicated.

`recipient_did` is optional. When specified, the `mediator` **MUST** only return messages sent to that recipient did.

If no messages are available to be sent, a `status` message **MUST** be sent immediately.

Delivered messages **MUST NOT** be deleted until delivery is acknowledged by a messages-received message.

### Message Delivery
Batch of messages delivered to the `recipient` as attachments.

Message Type URI: `https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/delivery`

```json
{
    "id": "123456780",
    "thid": "<message id of delivery-request message>",
    "type": "https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/delivery",
    "body": {
        "recipient_did": "<did for messages>"
    },
    "attachments": [{
        "id": "<id of message>",
        "data": {
            "base64": "<message>"
        }
    }]
}
```
Messages delivered from the queue must be delivered in a batch delivery message as attachments, with a batch size specified by the `limit` provided in the `delivery-request` message.
The `id` of each attachment is used to confirm receipt.
The `id` is an opaque value, and the recipient should not deduce any information from it, except that it is unique to the mediator. The recipient can use the `id`s in the `message_id_list` field of `messages-received`.

The ONLY valid type of attachment for this message is a DIDComm v2 Message in encrypted form.

The `recipient_did` attribute is only included when responding to a `delivery-request` message that indicates a `recipient_did`.

### Messages Received
After receiving messages, the `recipient` sends an acknowledge message indiciating which messages are safe to clear from the queue.

Message Type URI: `https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/messages-received`

```json
{
    "id": "123456780",
    "type": "https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/messages-received",
    "body": {
        "message_id_list": ["123","456"]
    },
    "return_route": "all"
}
```
`message_id_list` is a list of `ids` of each message received. The `id` of each message is present in the attachment descriptor of each attached message of a delivery message.

Upon receipt of this message, the `mediator` knows which messages have been received, and can remove them from the collection of queued messages with confidence. The `mediator` **SHOULD** send an updated `status` message reflecting the changes to the queue.

#### Multiple Recipients

If a message arrives at a `mediator` addressed to multiple `recipients`, the message **MUST** be queued for each `recipient` independently. If one of the addressed `recipients` retrieves a message and indicates it has been received, that message **MUST** still be held and then removed by the other addressed `recipients`.


### Live Mode
_Live Mode_ is the practice of delivering newly arriving messages directly to a connected `recipient`. It is disabled by default and only activated by the `recipient`. Messages that arrive when _Live Mode_ is off **MUST** be stored in the queue for retrieval as described above. If _Live Mode_ is active, and the connection is broken, a new inbound connection starts with _Live Mode_ disabled.

Messages already in the queue are not affected by _Live Mode_; they must still be requested with `delivery-request` messages.

_Live Mode_ **MUST** only be enabled when a persistent transport is used, such as WebSockets.

Recipients have three modes of possible operation for message delivery with various abilities and level of development complexity:

1. Never activate _Live Mode_. Poll for new messages with a `status_request` message, and retrieve them when available.
2. Retrieve all messages from queue, and then activate _Live Mode_. This simplifies message processing logic in the `recipient`.
3. Activate _Live Mode_ immediately upon connecting to the `mediator`. Retrieve messages from the queue as possible. When receiving a message delivered live, the queue may be queried for any waiting messages delivered to the same did for processing.
### Live Mode Change
_Live Mode_ is changed with a `live-delivery-change` message.

Message Type URI: `https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/live-delivery-change`

```json
{
    "id": "123456780",
    "type": "https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/live-delivery-change",
    "body": {
        "live_delivery": true
    }
}
```
Upon receiving the `live_delivery_change` message, the `mediator` **MUST* respond with a `status` message.

If sent with `live_delivery` set to true on a connection incapable of live delivery, a `problem_report` **SHOULD** be sent as follows:

```json
{
    "id": "123456780",
    "type": "https://didcomm.org/report-problem/2.0/problem-report",
    "pthid": "< the value is the thid of the thread in which the problem occurred>",
    "body": {
        "code": "e.m.live-mode-not-supported",
        "comment": "Connection does not support Live Delivery"
    }
}
```
