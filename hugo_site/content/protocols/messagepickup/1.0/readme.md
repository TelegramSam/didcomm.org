## Details

This protocol is defined here: https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/tree/main/features/0212-pickup

Note: as pointed in the abovementioned link, the version of this protocol is 1.0 and was defined initially in Hyperledger Aries using DIDComm v1 headers/decorators. Readers should be aware that thereâ€™s a new 3.0 version of this protocol that complies also with DIDComm v2 headers. Version 3.0 can be found [here](https://didcomm.org/messagepickup/3.0/)
